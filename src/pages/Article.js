                  Globally, some progress on women’s rights has been achieved.
                  In India, 83.3% of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and
                  monitor gender equality under the SDG indicator, with a focus
                  on violence against women, are in place. The adolescent birth
                  rate is 12.2 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 as of 2018, up from
                  10.7 per 1,000 in 2016. In 2016, 72.8% of women of
                  reproductive age (15-49 years) had their need for family
                  planning satisfied with modern methods. However, work still
                  needs to be done in India to achieve gender equality. 27.3% of
                  women aged 20–24 years old who were married or in a union
                  before age 18. As of February 2021, only 14.4% of seats in
                  parliament were held by women.
                  <li>
                    In 2018, 18.4% of women aged 15-49 years reported that they
                    had been subject to physical and/or sexual violence by a
                    current or former intimate partner in the previous 12
                    months. As of december 2020, only 44.3% of indicators needed
                    to monitor the SDGs from a gender perspective were
                    available, with gaps in key areas, in particular: unpaid
                    care and domestic work, key labour market indicators, such
                    as the gender pay gap and information and communications
                    technology skills. In addition, many areas – such as gender
                    and poverty, physical and sexual harassment, women’s access
                    to assets (including land), and gender and the environment –
                    lack comparable methodologies for reguar monitoring. Closing
                    these gender data gaps is essential for achieving
                    gender-related SDG commitments in India.
