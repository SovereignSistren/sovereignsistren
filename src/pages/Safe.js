              Women across India are subject to violence and harassment that
              significantly impacts their access to opportunities for
              advancement and socio-economic security. As per the 5th round of
              the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), 30% of women in India
              between the ages of 15-49 have experienced physical, sexual or
              domestic violence. Women’s safety and security are a top priority
              for both the central and state governments in India.

              A number of initiatives across states have been introduced to
              monitor and track timely resolution of crimes against women. Many
              innovative emergency response systems have also been developed for
              the police to rescue women in distress. As a part of the
              #CallItOut because #ItsNotOK campaign, best practices have been
              identified at the national and state levels to highlight
              innovations, facilitate knowledge transfer and coordinate efforts
              towards the prevention of harassment against women.

              <b>1. Hammer strike</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Using your car keys is one of the easiest ways to defend yourself.
              Don’t use your fingernails, because you’re more at risk to injure
              your hands. Instead, if you feel unsafe while walking at night,
              have your keys stick out from one side of your fist for hammer
              strikes. Another way to use your keys is to click them onto a
              lanyard to swing at your attacker.
            </p>
            <p>To perform:</p>
            <p>
              Hold your key ring in a tight fist, like holding a hammer, with
              keys extending from the side of your hand. Thrust downward toward
              your target.

            </p>
            <p>
              If someone is coming at you from the front, a groin kick may
              deliver enough force to paralyze your attacker, making your escape
              possible.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              To perform: Stabilize yourself as best you can. Lift your dominant
              leg off the ground and begin to drive your knee upward. Extend
              your dominant leg, drive hips forward, slightly lean back, and
              kick forcefully, making contact between your lower shin or ball of
              your foot and the attacker’s groin area. Alternative: If your
              attacker is too close, thrust your knee toward the groin. Make
              sure you’re stabilized and not at risk of falling over.

                <b>3. Heel palm strike:</b>
                This move can cause damage to the nose or throat. To execute,
                get in front of your attacker as much as is possible. To
                perform: With your dominant hand, flex your wrist. Aim for
                either the attacker’s nose, jabbing upward from the nostrils, or
                underneath the attacker’s chin, jabbing upward at the throat.
                Make sure to recoil your strike. Pulling your arm back quickly
                will help thrust the attacker’s head up and back. This will
                cause your attacker to stagger backward, allowing you to escape
                their grasp. Alternative: An open palm to the ears can be very
                disorienting.

              <li>
                <b>4. Elbow strike : </b>If your attacker is in close range and
                you’re unable to get enough momentum to throw a strong punch or
                kick, use your elbows. To perform: If you can, stabilize
                yourself with a strong core and legs to ensure a powerful blow.
                Bend your arm at the elbow, shift your weight forward, and
                strike your elbow into your attacker’s neck, jawline, chin, or
                temple. These are all effective targets. This may cause your
                attacker to loosen their grip, allowing you to run.

              <li>
                <b> 5. Alternative elbow strikes:</b>Depending on how you’re
                standing when you’re initially attacked, you may be in a better
                position for variations on the elbow strike. To perform from the
                front: Lift your elbow to shoulder height. Pivot on same-side
                foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more momentum into
                the front part of your elbow when you strike. To perform from
                the side and back: Make sure you see the target. Bring your
                elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips and
                turning into the target, making contact with the back part of
                your elbow.

                <b> 6. Escape from a ‘bear hug attack’ :</b>For cases where the
                attacker is coming from behind, you’ll want to use this move.
                Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself. To
                perform: Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight
                forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you
                up. It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side
                to side to the attacker’s face. Turn into the attacker with one
                of your elbows and continue counterattacking. This should give
                you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face
                or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created,
                you may be able to escape and run away.

              <li>
                <b>7. Escape with hands trapped : </b> If your attacker comes
                from behind and traps your arms (this is similar to a bear hug,
                but you won’t be able to move as freely), here’s what to do:
                First reaction should be to stop your attacker’s arms from going
                higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. This gives
                an opening for strikes to the groin with open-handed slaps.
                Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite
                elbow to turn into the wrap. Keep your arms tight to your chest
                as you’re turning in.
              </li>
              Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you
              can disengage.

              <li>
                <b>8. Escape from side headlock : </b> When the attacker locks
                their arm around your head from the side, your first instinct
                should be to avoid getting choked. To perform: Turn into the
                attacker’s side as much as possible to avoid being choked. With
                your hand that’s furthest away, strike the groin with
                open-handed slaps until you have enough mobility to turn your
                head all the way out to disengage. How to stay safe if you
                aren’t physically able to protect yourself However, if you don’t
                feel confident you’re able to physically handle an attacker,

                2.Call the police. Find a well-lit public area and dial 911 or
                your local emergency services if you feel you’re in danger.

                3.Carry protection. Whether pepper spray, a personal safety
                alarm, or a lipstick taser, self-defense tools can help you feel
                more at ease. Was this helpful?

            <p>
              If you’re carrying self-defense tools, make sure to get training
              on how to use them. You can also use more common objects as
              weapons,including a purse, briefcase, umbrella, phone, pencil,
              book, or rock. Anything blunt that can be used to hit, throw,
              stab, or swing can be very effective.
