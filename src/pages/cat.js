              Education is a crucial factor in the economic development of any
              country. In India, education is divided into two major stages:
              primary and secondary education . Primary education is the
              foundation of a child’s education and is essential for their
              intellectual and social development. It helps children develop
              basic literacy and numeracy skills, which are essential for their
              future academic success . Secondary education is the bridge that
              connects primary education with higher education. It is at this
              juncture that a student decides what profession they would like to
              pursue as a career . Secondary education is important because it
              promotes rational development in students through which they gain
              practical skills. It also strives to increase the practical
              efficiency of the students. The importance of secondary education
              in India aims for the all-around development of the student along
              with an understanding of the various vital branches of knowledge.
              It trains the student to become a good citizen and uplifts the
              democratic principle of the country. It inculcates the feeling of
              unity in diversity among the student and informs them how
              important they are for the social and economic development of the
              country . In addition, secondary education prepares young people
              for the labor market and is especially certain among those who
              leave for a job just after secondary education. With a large
              number of young people passing through secondary education, a
              country’s economic growth rate shifts from labor-intensive to
              knowledge-centric.

            <h3 className="textdecoration-underline">WOMEN EDUCATION:</h3>
            <p>
              Women education has been a blistering subject matter for
              insightful discussions all around the globe for a long time. We
              often hear people talk about how education is the primary tool to
              govern and achieve anything you want. It is one such tool no thief
              can steal. Many institutes, universities, colleges, and schools
              are established to educate the youth of our nation. Parents trust
              has made their children believe in themselves and has made their
              minds free of pessimistic thoughts. Yet, globally, more than
              two-thirds of women are illiterate of 796 million illiterate
              people. The dilemma lies in an individual education based on what
              education is to the family rather than the entire nation. The
              overall literacy rate in India is 74%, whereas the female literacy
              rate is 64.6%, which is drastically increasing every year through
              various government benefits offered. Different factors found to be
              responsible for the decrease in the female literacy rate.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Social discrimination</li>
              <li>Gender inequality</li>
              <li>Occupation of girl child in domestic chores</li>
              <li>Economic exploitation</li>
              <ul>
                <p>
                  Other reasons that are commonly mentioned for girls drop-out
                  rates at the primary and middle school level are,
                </p>
              </ul>
              <li>Costs too much</li>
              <li>Less interest in studies</li>
              <li>Early-age marriage</li>
              <li>Required for work in the family business or farm</li>
              <li>Required for household work</li>
              <p>
                Apart from the above reasons, the non-availability of
                educational centers in close proximity, unsafe means of travel,
                and lack of proper toilets are additional reasons for girls
                drop-outs.

              accomplished through many channels, and at varying points in
              someone career. Here are some different resources for receiving

            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>High School CTE programs</li>
                <li>Tech prep education</li>
                <li>Postsecondary vocational school</li>
                <li>Apprenticeship programs</li>

              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>High school CTE programs:</li>
              CTE programs are designed for high school students hoping to gain
              work experience in a variety of trades, as well as continue their
              academic studies. This type of vocational training is often
              offered as part of a high school curriculum, but students can also
              attend separate vocational training centers. These vocational
              training programs allow students to explore different career
              choices and prepare for industry-specific work or advanced
              education. In most vocational training programs at this level,
              students continue to pursue their high school diploma while
              completing their training.
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>Postsecondary vocational school:</li>
              Sometimes referred to as trade schools, postsecondary vocational
              schools are another viable option for individuals considering
              attending a community or four-year college. They offer degree
              programs as well as vocational certificates and are usually
              designed to cater to working adults by offering night and weekend
              course options. Attending a postsecondary vocational school is
              typically required in trades such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cosmetology</li>
              <li>Massage therapy</li>
              <li>Carpentry</li>
              <li>Culinary arts</li>
              <li>Auto mechanics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Many trade schools focus on a specific career or industry. Types
              of vocational schools include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanical and automotive schools</li>
              <li>Business schools</li>
              <li>Culinary schools</li>
              <li>Art and design schools</li>
              <li>Cosmetology schools</li>
              <li>Education programs</li>
              <li>Health care schools</li>
              <li>Legal and criminal justice schools</li>
              <li>Real estate schools</li>
              <li>Technology schools</li>
              <li>Travel and tourism schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <li>Apprenticeship programs</li>
              Apprenticeship programs are trade-specific and can last as long as
              four or five years. In these types of programs, the apprentice, or
              student, works under the supervision of a professional in their
              trade and they are compensated for the work. This type of
              vocational training is most common in highly skilled, hands-on
              professions. Apprenticeships typically combine on-the-job training
              with classroom instruction. Because some apprenticeships include
              classroom courses, they can result in a certification or degree. A
              major benefit of this type of training is the fact that it is an
              educational program in which the student is paid. Due to this,
              placement in apprenticeship programs is usually competitive.
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>On-the-job training</li>
              Most on-the-job training is either done through an employer or a
              third-party training provider sourced by the employer.
              ItclassName=s common for companies to provide employees with
              job-specific training as well as training in general employment
              skills, such as human resources training, training on how to work
              well in a team or computer skills training. These skills can prove
              valuable in an employeeclassName=s current position, as well as in
              any future employment opportunities. When learning a skill through
              on-the-job training, new employees are often paired with someone
              who is more experienced. Classroom instruction may also be
              utilized for on-the-job training, but itclassName=s typically only
              seen when a company develops its on-the-job training program into
              an apprenticeship program.
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>Distance learning programs</li>
              Another great option for learning or expanding a set of skills is
              by enrolling in a distance education program. Many distance
              learning programs allow students to work through materials and
              lesson plans at their own pace, making it perfect for working
              professionals. However, some distance learning programs will
              require students to be logged in at specific times or follow a
              course schedule. Before signing up for a distance learning
              program, be sure to research the institution thoroughly, making
              sure that they are legitimate as well as accredited.

              Music, sports, and life skills education can be effective tools to
              promote socio-emotional well-being in children. According to a
              study, music education can play a role in healing, particularly
              when it’s paired with deep breathing exercises. Music is readily
              available from sources like YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora, which
              makes it easy to integrate into the classroom, and research shows
              that general music program activities like improvisation and
              identifying emotion through music are effective as a form of
              social and emotional learning . Sports can also help children
              learn to control their emotions and channel negative feelings in a
              positive way. Playing sports helps children build resilience and
              feel better about themselves . Life skills education can help
              children develop social and emotional skills, such as
              self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship
              skills, and responsible decision-making. These skills can help
              children manage their emotions, build healthy relationships, and
              make responsible decisions . Incorporating music, sports, and life
              skills education into children’s daily routine can help them
              develop social and emotional skills, which can lead to better
              mental health and well-being in the long run.
