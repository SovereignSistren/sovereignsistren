              Women are the backbone of marginal farmer households in India.
              They work hard in the field, prepare meals, raise children, tend
              to animals and maintain the household. Given their intrinsic
              tendency to put family first, women are also the most affected
              during crises. Yet, these women are not often recognised formally
              as farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small-scale women farmers in the Global South face an array of
              issues in agriculture – such as lack of direct access to markets –
              as well as those deriving from unequal gender norms and practices.
              For instance, they often endure irregularity of work, low and
              unequal wages, fewer employment opportunities, lack of skill
              development as well as minimal income and food security even after
              working long hours. All of these difficulties are compounded by
              growing environmental challenges such as soil degradation,
              unseasonal rains, depleting water tables, and more. Rural
              households – and women in particular – are often left without
              adequate access to food.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Food security cannot be viewed in isolation. Instead, it must be
              approached together with nutrition security and sustainable
              agriculture, as well as access to agricultural inputs, the latest
              available technologies, and information, among others.
              Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) has taken several simple
              yet innovative initiatives to facilitate access to
              climate-resilient agriculture and ensure nutritious food for our
              members.

                <b>Building resilient rural communities</b>
              </li>
              <b>SEWA</b> : (Self employed womens association) has initiated a
              number of national and regional agriculture campaigns to support
              small-scale, marginalised women farmers. A working model for
              agricultural development was created which approaches the farm as
              an enterprise, shifting the focus from solely subsistence to
              profitability. Climate-resilient practices have been gradually
              interwoven into this model over the past several decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under this agriculture campaign, the women farmers are organised
              into collectives based on the different crops they grow. This
              enables aggregation, increased negotiating capacity, and access to
              mainstream markets as well as financial and technical services.
              Small-scale female farmers in India are often not noted in land
              records, and as a result, they are not eligible to access
              government-certified subsidised seeds. To address this, SEWA is
              training women farmers to move towards regenerative farming
              practices. This entails reviving the traditional seed-bank concept
              wherein a few members from every district are trained in seed
              plotting (producing and preserving seeds from their harvest) which
              they can then sell locally in their village. This generates
              livelihood opportunities and enables access to good quality
              certified seeds for other smallholder women farmers in the
              village.

                <b>The Rural Distribution Network</b>
              </li>
              One of SEWA’s pioneering initiatives is the Rural Distribution
              Network (RUDI) – a network in which the entire value chain is
              owned, managed and operated by low-income grassroots women
              workers. RUDI creates a rural supply chain that builds jobs,
              provides income for farmers and improves food and nutrition
              security at the household level. It does this by first procuring
              agricultural produce directly from small and marginal female
              farmers at fair prices, essentially eliminating the ‘middleman’
              and enabling direct market access. Second, RUDI trains rural women
              to grade, process and package the produce. Lastly, a large team of
              trained saleswomen from vulnerable communities bring the
              affordable products to remote households. RUDI positively impacts
              marginalised households in a number of ways. Approximately 15,000
              small and marginal farmers sell their produce to RUDI every year,
              at their doorsteps for rates that are 20 to 30 per cent better
              than those offered by traders. More than 300 marginalised women
              are employed at RUDI processing centres, earning between 5,000 to
              8,000 Indian Rupees (INR) per month. More than 4,000 saleswomen
              deliver RUDI products to rural households, earning them a monthly
              income between 2,000 to 10,000 INR.

              <li>
                <b>Technology and services</b>
              </li>
              In addition, SEWA supports small-scale farmers with agri-advisory
              services. By providing information about the weather, pest and
              disease, and sowing, farmers can adopt best practices and receive
              better returns for their crops. Typically, farmers depend on
              fellow farmers and input dealers for advice on such problems, but
              SEWA is helping small and marginal farmers build their resilience
              and make informed decisions. Mobile phone technology can be a
              useful tool to better communicate with and educate farmers in
              these situations. It can help overcome the distance between
              farmers and resources and, at the same time, provide the necessary
              information. To this end, SEWA has started using the pre-recorded
              messages relayed over a voice call, which is then sent via
              WhatsApp. Voice Message Based Mobile Technology fills the
              information gap regarding weather prediction, crop advisory, the
              market price of commodities, government schemes related to
              agriculture, and more.

                <b>The way forward</b>
              </li>
              The success of initiatives like RUDI under SEWA’s agriculture
              campaign has shown that if scaled up, they can help the sector
              become more sustainable, viable and profitable. In addition, they
              can help to address food and nutrition security challenges and
              improve energy access in rural areas. At the same time, generating
              livelihood opportunities in rural areas can curb rural emigration,
              mitigate poverty, reduce the carbon footprint of villages and,
              above all, provide income security to poor rural informal workers.

              As leading economies in the world pledge to become carbon neutral,
              a huge opportunity lies in Indias villages to advance the country
              on the path to decarbonization and ensure a green economic
              recovery. With pilots underway, Hariyali Green Village Plans aim
              to demonstrate a model to transform village energy use in India by
              making clean energy available and affordable while improving
              livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two out of every three people in India, over 870 million people,
              reside in villages and despite tremendous progress in recent
              years, millions of them still do not have access to reliable and
              clean electricity. Polluting fossil fuels account for nearly all
              energy used for transportation, and 70% of all energy consumed for
              irrigation in agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Green Village Plans, developed by NRDC and partner, the
              Self-Employed Womens Association (SEWA), are based on extensive
              in-person surveys of household-level energy consumption conducted
              in two pilot villages - Nagano Math in Gujarat, and Beraniya in
              Rajasthan. Each plan is women-led, and brings together
              stakeholders including local communities,
              suppliers, financiers, and government officials to implement
              effective clean energy solutions for the village.

              As part of the Green Village Plans, NRDC and SEWA are

              While appliance ownership in most households is low, electricity
              expenses are significant. Through SEWAs field staff and grassroots
              network, the team has worked on explaining the economics of
              efficient appliances and provisions of the state and national
              solar pumps schemes to households. Supported by Energy Efficiency
              Services Limited (EESL). families in each Green Village will have
              the option to purchase a package of energy efficient appliances
              such as LED lamps and high efficiency ceiling fans at
              significantly low cost and with overall savings on their energy
              bills. The appliance package also includes solar lamps to reduce
              expense on kerosene and provide night-time illumination.

              NRDC and SEWAs fieldwork, communities have expressed interest in
              clean energy solutions - such as solar water pumps, electric three
              wheelers and solar-based milk chillers - that can help enhance
              livelihoods. But households are wary of incurring large
              expenditure without demonstration of successful operations. For
              each village, SEWA and NRDC are exploring group models of
              ownership for expensive livelihood appliances, such as solar
              pumps and working on supporting farmers interested in water-saving

              </li>
              Community spaces in many villages in India lack access to clean
              energy services. For the two pilot villages surveyed, there were
              no streetlights in either of them; and one of them had no
              electricity in the primary school. In addition to meeting basic
              energy needs, clean energy interventions in community spaces can
              also serve as good demonstration sites for the village. Hence,
              NRDC and SEWA have developed plans for a green school where
              students will be introduced at an early age to clean and efficient
              technologies and can learn more about them through experience. The
