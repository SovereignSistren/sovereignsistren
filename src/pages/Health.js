                        <b>HEART DISEASE :-</b>
                        <br />
                        According to the Centers for Disease Control and
                        Prevention (CDC), only 56% of women recognize that heart
                        disease is the leading cause of death for women. While
                        sometimes heart disease is thought of more prominently
                        among men, the CDC reported that this disease was
                        responsible for 1 in 5 female deaths in 2019.Further,
                        most women between the ages of 40 and 60 have at least
                        one or more risk factors for heart disease and may not
                        even realize it.Post-menopause as well as early
                        menstruation are uncontrollable risk factors for heart
                        disease that are specific to women.However, many risk
                        factors can be helped. In fact, in 95% of deaths from
                        heart disease, the individual had at least one of these
                        major risk factors
                        <ul>
                          <li>Smoking</li>
                          <li>High blood pressure</li>
                          <li>High blood cholesterol</li>
                          <li>Overweight</li>
                          <li>Physical inactivity</li>
                          <li>Diabetes</li>
                        </ul>
                        For instance, people who smoke are up to six times more
                        likely than nonsmokers to suffer a heart attack. Smoking
                        is the No. 1 cause of preventable death and disease in
                        the United States. Other risk factors such as age and
                        family history cannot be helped. You can reduce your
                        risk for heart disease by up to 82% by adopting a
                        heart-healthy lifestyle.

                        <b> BREAST CANCER:-</b> <br />
                        The most common type of cancer in women in the U.S. is
                        breast cancer. Breast cancer begins in the breast and
                        occurs when cells change and grow. The ducts and lobules
                        are the two parts of the breast where cancer is most
                        likely to start. There are approximately 240,000 new
                        cases of invasive breast cancer as well as 50,000 new
                        cases of noninvasive breast cancer diagnosed each year
                        in the U.S. The major identified risk factor categories
                        for this type of cancer pertain to hormone and family
                        history. In addition to this, other prior medical
                        problems, including past history of premalignant breast
                        biopsies, dense breast tissue and history of chest wall
                        radiation, can increase a womans risk for breast cancer.
                        While these risk factors are important, 70% of newly
                        diagnosed women have no special risk factors except
                        female sex and advancing age. Research has indicated
                        that women with the following lifestyle risk factors
                        have an increased chance of developing breast cancer:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Alcohol use</li>

                        CERVICAL CANCER Ovarian Cancer starts in the ovaries,
                        walnut-sized organs located on both sides of the uterus.
                        Cancer can affect any of the complex cells within the
                        ovaries and since only women have ovaries, this type of
                        cancer can only be found in women. Ovarian cancer often
                        shows no symptoms until after it has spread outside of
                        the ovaries. Even then, symptoms tend to be vague and
                        are like those of other more common diseases. Cervical
                        Cancer is the occurrence of abnormal growth of the cells
                        of the cervix, the lower end of the uterus that connects
                        the uterus to the vagina. This type of cancer cell
                        growth typically starts in the outer layer called the
                        squamous cells. In most women, cervical cancer is caused
                        by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infection is very
                        common and often goes away on its own. However, in some
                        instances, over time, HPV can lead to cervical cancer.
                        HPV infection is strongly linked to cervical cancer. But
                        its important to keep in mind that most women with HPV
                        don’t develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors

                        DEPRESSION Depression effects the whole body. This
                        involves one’s body, mood and mind. With this said,
                        depression is more than feeling blue or unhappy and it
                        is not a sign of personal weakness. It is important to
                        recognize that depression is in fact an illness and just
                        like any other illness, depression often requires
                        treatment. While there is no clear cause, depression has
                        been linked to chemical imbalances in the brain. In
                        addition to this, environmental, mental health, physical
                        and inherited factors can play a role in the causation
                        of depression. According to Jyoti Sachdeva, MD, director
                        of womens mental health at UC Health’s West Chester
                        Hospital and associate professor in the Department of
                        Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the UC College
                        of Medicine, women have one-and-a-half to three times
                        higher rates of depression. This means women are about
                        twice as likely to have depression than men, as many
                        hormonal factors and potential additional stresses may
                        add to this increased rate in women. Dr. Sachdeva
                        explains that women are specifically at risk during
                        times of hormonal changes such as puberty, menopause,
                        pregnancy and postpartum.

                        ANXIETY Anxiety is a natural part of the body’s defense
                        system. In fact, normal anxiety can be helpful as it
                        works to alert your body of a threat. In this state, an
                        individual’s feelings can often range from a vague
                        sensation of worry to physical sensations such as a
                        racing heartbeat. However, when an individual has an
                        anxiety disorder, this response can happen at
                        inappropriate times when there is no apparent threat.
                        Anxiety can become an issue when it interferes with
                        day-to-day life, is hard to control and occurs for
                        months. With some anxiety disorders, the anxiety is way
                        out of proportion to the threat that triggers it. With
                        others, anxiety may occur even when there isn’t a clear
                        threat or trigger. Anxiety disorders tend to run in
                        families and are most common in women and younger
                        people. However, no age, race or gender is immune to
                        anxiety disorders.

                        <b>TYPE 2 DIABETES:-</b> <br />
                        Type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a
                        problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as
                        a fuel. That sugar also is called glucose. This
                        long-term condition results in too much sugar
                        circulating in the blood. Eventually, high blood sugar
                        levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous
                        and immune systems. In type 2 diabetes, there are
                        primarily two problems. The pancreas does not produce
                        enough insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement
                        of sugar into the cells. And cells respond poorly to
                        insulin and take in less sugar. Type 2 diabetes used to
                        be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and
                        type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and
                        adulthood.Theres no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing
                        weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the
                        disease. If diet and exercise arent enough to control
                        blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may
                        be recommended. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often
                        develop slowly. In fact, you can be living with type 2
                        diabetes for years and not know it. When symptoms are
                        present, they may include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Increased thirst.</li>

                        your annual womens wellness exam is a crucial step for
                        preventive care. Doctors recommend that women between
                        the ages of 21 and 65 have a Pap smear done every three
                        years. It is also recommended if you are 21 or older to
                        have a pelvic exam done once a year. If you have any
                        concerning symptoms, then you should schedule a visit as
                        soon as possible.

                        Develop good sleep hygiene and routines. In other words,
                        don’t stay up late every night when you know you have to
                        wake up early in the morning (also referred to as
                        revenge bedtime procrastination). Limit your time and
                        exposure to blue light from electronic devices like
                        laptops, tablets, TVs, and phones 30 minutes to an hour
                        before going to bed. Instead of scrolling, try reading
                        or journaling before bed. Winding down will help signal
                        to your brain that its time to rest and help you get a
                        better nights sleep (poor sleep often leads to other

                        one of the biggest risk factors to reproductive health,
                        notes the World Health Organization. Practicing good
                        sexual hygiene, such as washing sex toys and urinating
                        and showering after intercourse, can also help prevent
                        UTIs. Using condoms or other barrier methods can help

                        Stress reduction is key for disease prevention. There
                        are many ways to manage, cope with, and reduce your

                        and managing your stress is finding what works best for
                        you personally. Minimizing your screen time, spending
                        time outdoors, and practicing mindfulness, either
                        through mediation or another practice, such as gratitude
                        journaling, are all excellent strategies. Connecting

                        engaging in pleasurable activities, such as a hobby

                        the food you eat, this isn’t always possible or

                        professionals. Ask your doctor which supplements are
                        best for you. If you are pregnant, have food allergies

                        Make time for regular physical activity. Regular
                        exercise is one of the best ways for women to prevent
                        common health issues. For managing stress, heart health
                        problems, and mental health issues, daily movement —
                        even as little as 30 minutes — can make a huge
                        difference. The CDC recommends daily movement for 30
                        minutes a day, five days per week for adults. Physical
                        activity doesnt have to mean going to the gym — unless
                        you love it! It can be any physical activity that
                        increases your heart rate, such as a fast-paced walk,
                        dancing, riding your bike, or taking your pet outside.
                        It may also be motivating and fun to invite a friend to
                        join you on your walk, ride, or a new fitness class such

                        activities outside of your normal routine. Its important

                        spontaneity! Maybe this looks like a drive to the beach
                        one weekend or another favorite spot you havent had time

                        productive, during which you can do something fun or
                        enjoyable for yourself, like a apply a face mask at the
